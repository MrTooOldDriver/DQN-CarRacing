# DQN-CarRacing
One of our first attempt at solving Gym's CarRacing-v0 environment using DQN. The current state of this agent is that it has yet to find a solution (by getting average reward of 900 over 100 consecutive trials for the game to be considered 'solved').

Some experiments where being done with this file (like a proper statistical study of the final result), but not all will be uploaded here.

This is based (and cleaned a bit) from [Luc Prieur's solution](https://gist.github.com/lmclupr/b35c89b2f8f81b443166e88b787b03ab#file-race-car-cv2-nn-network-td0-15-possible-actions-ipynb), before Gym's website was officially taken down due to high maintenance costs.
